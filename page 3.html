<p>Dance</p>
<p>Now its time for one of my favourite subjects dance.
<p>A lot of people are surprised when I tell them I took dance as a subject because they thought that you would have to take P.E for dance not knowing it is a separate subject.
<p>People usually think that taking and just doing dance is boring but in class we learn different types of dance techniques.</p>
<ul>Different types of dance would be 
<li>Jazz</li>
<li>Hip hop</li>
<li>Contemporary</li>
<li>And many more that I cant remember</li>
</ul>
<p>I've only been doing dance for about a year so I cant really do any cool tricks or be very flexible when we do leaps and stuff but I like to think I'm good at remembering and performing.
<p>Now another picture :).<p>
