<h1> Something </h1>
<p>Hi, everyone is writing really weird stuff and guess what? I don't know what to write;).No surprise there.Ill probably try and come up with something later but just now ill just write random stuff like what I done the other day.
<p>Guys I have just had an amazing idea so you know that I said I didn't know what to write about why don't I write about something that everyone has and does in their daily routine (well I don't think they do it on weekends but they can if there the biggest nerd ever).So you guys want to know what amazing idea that I'm going to spend about 3 or 4 pages on. My idea is ... subjects.Aren't you guys so proud of me coming up with a good idea that everyone loves and can relate to :D.
<p>And now here is a giant picture to fill the rest of the page because I (once again) cant think of anything to write but please enjoy reading about some of my subjects.
<p>Now please enjoy this giant picture that takes up the rest of this page ;).</p>
