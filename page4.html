<h1>Page 4</h1>
<p>All right I never knew you had to have 4 pages so expect much on this page.On this page I am just going to do this sentence and the other sentence I wrote before so yeah.</p>
<p>Okay so I have to write more on this page but I really cant be bothered so yeah this will probably just be a really weird and boring page with a lot of weird sentences that probably doesn't make any sense so yeah enjoy :)...... or just go to another page that's less weird and boring than this.</p>
<p>Okay em emm emmm ...... yeah.</p>
<p>Lets talk about ...... how I wish at least one of my G friends were in this class and that I aren't surrounded by boys. Some of the boys are soooo nippy but others are all right I suppose.</p>  
<p>Okay I'm bored like usual so I'm just going to try re upload this page and do other useless stuff that wont help me in anyway towards my education of knowledge ;) <p/>
<p> By the way expect a lot of smiley faces or winking faces cause that usually means I'm being sarcastic or I just really cant be bothered writing it.</p>  
<p> Ugh so bored.</p>
