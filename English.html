<h1>English</h1> 
<p>As you can tell I have ran out of things to say so here's a page about English cause it is my "favourite" subject.I'm kidding I absolutely hate English its the most boring subject ever id rather do Math than English. So lets start ,English it is one of the main subjects at school ,the most important some parents might say.
<p>But is it my favourite subject? NO its not but lets just talk about it anyway.</p>
<ul>Why its not my favourite subject
<li>It is boring</li>
<li>I can't do it</li>
<li>Again its boring </li>
<li>I don't like my teacher (not gonna say who)</li>
