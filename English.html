<h1>English</h1> 
<p>As you can tell I have ran out of things to say so here's a page about English cause it is my "favourite" subject.I'm kidding I absolutely hate English its the most boring subject ever id rather do Maths than English. So lets start ,English it is one of the main subjects at school ,the most important some parents might say.
<p>But is it my favourite subject? NO its not but lets just talk about it anyway.</p>
<ul>Why its not my favourite subject
<li>It is boring</li>
<li>I can't do it</li>
<li>I don't like my teacher (not gonna say who)</li>
<li>It is boring</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah they are the reasons why I hate English :)<p>
<p> You know how I said I didn't like my teacher? Yeah? well I don't think he likes me either cause I never hand my essays back in on time and I never read the books for homework. 
<p>And talking about books from English why the hell do they pick the most boring and most hard to read books, like if you're going waste my time by making me read a book pick an interesting one or something that has words that are actually in dictionary or pick something that doesn't make me fall asleep then when you ask a question idk what happening.Like come on (there's no rolling eye emoji so I'm just gonna write it in brackets) (rolling eyes emoji).
<p>The only good thing really is that I sit next to my friend and that is very rare in some classes like biology idk if anyone else has the same problem or something</p>
<p> Just realized I've said idk a lot in this page thing and if you are a noob and you don't know what it means it just means "I don't know" so there you go problem solved :)</p>
